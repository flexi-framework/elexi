(TGV)=
# Taylor Green Vortex
This tutorial describes how to set up and run a basic test case for turbulent flows, the Taylor--Green vortex (TGV) {cite}`Taylor1937`. The TGV is started from eight Fourier modes with the initial conditions given by Gassner et al. {cite}`gassner2013accuracy`. In this tutorial, we will learn how to avoid catastrophic failure of the code due to non-linear instabilities. This is done by using polynomial dealiasing or entropy/energy stable split flux formulations. In a second step, we add the sub-grid scale (SGS) model of Smagorinsky. The tutorial is located at `tutorials/tgv`.

## Flow description
The initial condition to the (TGV) is a sinus distribution in the $u$ and $v$ velocity components. This leads to rapid production of turbulent structures, after a short initial laminar phase. While the test case is incompressible in principle, we solve it here in a compressible setting. The chosen Mach number with respect to the highest velocity in the field is $M = 0.1$. The Reynolds number of the flow is defined as $1/\mu = 6.25 \cdot 10^{-4}$. The domain is set up as a triple periodic box with edge length $L = 2\pi$.

## Mesh Generation
We use a mesh with $4$ cells per direction for the tutorial. In case you want to generate other meshes, the parameter file for [HOPR][hopr] is included in the tutorial directory (`parameter_hopr.ini`), together with the default mesh. Using $4$ cells with a polynomial degree of $N = 7$ results in a typical large eddy setup of $32$ degrees of freedom (DOF) per direction.

## Compiler Options
Depending on the dealiasing strategy used, [FLEXI][flexi] should be compiled either with the `tgv_overintegration`, `tgv_split_lobatto` or `tgv_split_gauss` preset using the following commands

```{code-block} bash
cmake -B build --preset tgv_overintegration
cmake --build build
```
```{code-block} bash
cmake -B build --preset tgv_split_lobatto
cmake --build build
```
or
```{code-block} bash
cmake -B build --preset tgv_split_gauss
cmake --build build
```
respectively.

## Simulation Parameters
The parameter file to run the simulation is supplied as `parameter_flexi.ini`.

###### Interpolation
```ini
! ============================================================ !
! INTERPOLATION
! ============================================================ !
N             = 7
```
The parameter `N` sets the degree of the solution polynomial. In this example, the solution is approximated by a polynomial of degree $3$ in each spatial direction. This results in $(N+1)^3 = 512$ degrees of freedom for each (3D) element. In general, *N* can be chosen to be any integer greater or equal to $1$, however, the discretization and the timestep calculation has not extensively been tested beyond $N\approx 23$. Usually, for a good compromise of performance and accuracy is found for $N\in[3,..,9]$.

###### Overintegration
To apply polynomial dealiasing there are the following options in [FLEXI][flexi].
```ini
! ============================================================ !
! OVERINTEGRATION (ADVECTION PART ONLY)
! ============================================================ !
OverintegrationType = 0  ! 0:off
                         ! 1:cut-off filter
                         ! 2: conservative cut-off

NUnder              = 7  ! specifies effective polydeg
                         ! (modes > NUnder are thrown away)
                         ! only for types 1 and 2
```
In mode $0$, polynomial dealiasing is disabled. [FLEXI][flexi] has two ways of doing polynomial dealiasing. In mode $1$, a filter is applied to the time-update $\mathcal{J}U_t$. The filter is formulated as a Galerkin projection of degree $N$ to `NUnder`, the effective resolution is thus `NUnder`. Mode $2$ is in principle identical to mode $1$, but takes into account non-linear metric terms present in curved meshes. For the linear mesh in this tutorial, the result is identical. Since mode $2$ is slightly more computational expensive, we omit it in the present tutorial.

###### Kinetic/Entropy Stable Formulations
An additional dealiasing technique is provided by entropy/kinetic energy stable split formulations of the DGSEM. In [FLEXI][flexi], implementations either on `Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto` or on `Legendre-Gauss` integration points are available and depending on the chosen compile option. The respective split flux formulation can be specified by the following option. The most commonly used are `PI`, `CH` and `SD`. While the option `PI` {cite}`pirozzoli2010` enables the use of a kinetic energy stable formulation, the option `CH` {cite}`chandrashekar2013` provides an entropy conservative formulation of the DGSEM. Finally, the parameter choice `SD` yields a flux differencing form of the DGSEM which is equivalent to the standard DGSEM formulation.
```ini
! ============================================================ !
! SPLIT DG
! ============================================================ !
SplitDG             = PI ! PI: kinetic energy preserving formulation
                         ! CH: entropy conserving formulation
                         ! SD: standard DGSEM in flux differencing formulation
```

###### Riemann Solvers
Besides the inherent filtering properties of the DG operator, the only additional artificial dissipation is then provided by the Riemann solver used for the inter-cell fluxes. You can change the Riemann solver to see the effect with the following parameters:
```ini
! ============================================================ !
! Riemann
! ============================================================ !
Riemann             =  RoeEntropyFix ! Riemann solver to be used:
                                     ! LF, HLLC, Roe,
                                     ! RoeEntropyFix, HLL, HLLE, HLLEM
```
```{attention}
Be aware that from the above listed Riemann solvers, only the implementations of `LF`, `Roe` and `RoeEntropyFix` are compatible for the use with split flux formulations.
```

###### Sub-Grid Scale Model
To add sub-grid scale (SGS) model by Smagorinsky, set the parameter `eddyViscType = 1`. Here, `CS` is the Smagorinsky constant which is usually chosen around `CS = 0.1` for isotropic turbulence (such as in the TGV).
```ini
! ============================================================ !
! LES MODEL
! ============================================================ !
eddyViscType        = 0   ! Choose LES model, 1:Smagorinsky
CS                  = 0.1 ! Smagorinsky constant
PrSGS               = 0.6 ! turbulent Prandtl number
```

## Simulation and Results
We proceed by running the code with the following command.
```bash
flexi parameter_flexi.ini
```
If **FLEXI** was compiled with MPI support, it can also be run in parallel with the following command. Here, `<NUM_PROCS>` is an integer denoting the number of processes to be used in parallel.
```bash
mpirun -np <NUM_PROCS> flexi parameter_flexi.ini
```
```{important}
**FLEXI** uses an element-based domain decomposition approach for parallelization. Consequently, the minimum load per process is *one* grid element, i.e. do not use more processes than grid elements!
```
This test case generates an analysis output file named `<PROJECTNAME>_TGVAnalysis.csv`, which we use to examine the results. Instead of focusing on flow visualization, this tutorial centers on analyzing key quantities directly from this analysis output data. Among other interesting quantities, the analysis file contains the incompressible dissipation rate, stored in the second column of the file. This is the resolved dissipation of the gradient field, computed as the integral over the domain of the strain rate tensor norm $S_{ij}S_{ij}$, times viscosity times $2$. We will use this quantity in the tutorial to verify your results. You can visualize the `csv` file in your favored plotting tool, e.g., within [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/) using the option `Line Chart View`.

```{math}
\mathrm{DR}_S = \frac{2 \mu}{\rho_0 \lVert \Omega \rVert } \int_\Omega S_{ij} S_{ij} ~ d\mathbf{x}

### Part I: Crashing Simulation
First, we run [FLEXI][flexi] without any kind of dealiasing technique. For this, use the [FLEXI][flexi] version compiled with the preset `tgv_overintegration`. We will find that the code crashes, once scale production becomes relevant. The same holds for the split form DGSEM if used with the `SD` split flux and the preset `tgv_split_lobatto` or `tgv_split_lobatto`- You can compare your result to the `crash_no_dealiasing.csv` file in the tutorial folder.

```

### Part II: Overintegration
We now use overintegration by changing the respective settings in the `parameter_flexi.ini` file as described above. Set `OverintegrationType = 1` and specify `N = 11` and `NUnder = 7`. You can compare your result to the `les_overintegration.csv` file in the tutorial folder.
```{figure} ./figures/tgv_overintegration.jpg

### Part III: Split Formulation
We now use the split DGSEM formulation as a dealiasing technique. Please be aware to use [FLEXI][flexi] either compiled with the preset `tgv_split_lobatto` or `tgv_split_gauss`. Set `SplitDG = PI` and specify `N = 7`. Don't forget to switch off overintegration. You can compare your result to the `les_split.csv` file in the tutorial folder.

### Part VI: Explicit LES model
To see the effect of adding explicit eddy viscosity, we activate the LES model (Smagorinsky) as described above via `eddyViscType = 1`. To obtain the reference result in `les_smago.csv`, set `CS = 0.1`. Don't forget to switch back to the compiler preset `tgv_overintegration` and deactivate overintegration `OverintegrationType = 0`. Use a polynomial degree of `N=7`.

### Part V: Have Fun!
Feel free to play around with the effect of the constant in the Smagorinsky model or compare the different dealiasing techniques with respect to accuracy or compute time. Most important, have fun with [FLEXI][flexi].
